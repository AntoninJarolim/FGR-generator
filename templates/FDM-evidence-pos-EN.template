Comment (for context):
{{source}}

Claim (extracted from the comment):
{{claim}}

Text:
{{clean_text}}

Your task is to identify the smallest possible parts of the Text that directly support the claim.

Focus on the phrases that most clearly justify or confirm the truth of the claim.
Do not select whole sentences unless absolutely necessary—choose the shortest meaningful spans that stand on their own.
You may select multiple spans if more than one part of the text provides evidence.

Do not modify, correct, or rewrite the text. Keep all grammatical and syntactic errors exactly as they appear in the original.

Return only a JSON object of type Dict[str, List[str]] with the key 'spans' and a list of selected spans as its value.

Important: Every selected span must be an exact substring of the given Text — character-for-character identical.
Do not paraphrase, retype, or alter any character (including punctuation, spacing, or capitalization).
